**2.2.3 Questions**
1. In the StudentMain class, indicate the line of program code used for the instance process!
What is the name of the resulting object?
2. How do I access the attributes and methods of an object?
3. Why are the output output results of the method tampilkanInformasi() first and second
different?

**answer**
1. The resulting object name is mhs1
2. Using the dot operator (.) — e.g., mhs1.nama = "Ali" to access an attribute, and mhs1.tampilkanInformasi() to call a method.
3. Because between the first and second calls, the methods ubahKelas("SI 2K") and updateIpk(3.60) were called, which changed the kelas and ipk attributes. The second call reflects the updated values.
